# Hands-on assignment 4 – Self assessment

## Checklist

**Every RDF file:**

- [ ] Uses the .nt extension
- [ ] Is serialized in the NTriples format
- [x] Follows the resource naming strategy
- [x] Uses class and property URIs that are the same as those used in the ontology

**Every URI in the RDF files:**

- [x] Is "readable" and has some meaning (e.g., it is not an auto-increased integer) 
- [x] Is not encoded as a string
- [x] Does not contain a double slash (i.e., “//”)

**Every individual in the RDF files:**

- [x] Has a label with the name of the individual
- [x] Has a type

**Every value in the RDF files:**

- [x] Is trimmed
- [x] Is properly encoded (e.g., dates, booleans)
- [x] Includes its datatype
- [x] Uses the correct datatype (e.g., values of 0-1 may be booleans and not integers, not every string made of numbers is a number)

## Comments on the self-assessment
- RDFs are in .ttl format, as requested on Moodle. As such, they are not serialized as NTriples
- knowledge-graph: graph for Defibrillators; knowledge-graph2: graph for clinics
- The only double slashes ("//") in the URIs are after the protocol ("http(s)://...")
- Morph-kgc automatically omits the datatype of xsd:string; all strings are in quotation marks, but with no datatype. All other literals have their datatype specified
- Addresses don't have rdf:label's because they are labeled with nsont:location as per our ontology schema
