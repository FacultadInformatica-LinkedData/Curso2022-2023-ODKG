Yuxiao Xiong; estrellaxyx; Best Books Ever Dataset; https://zenodo.org/record/4265096#.YyNPQy1JmRs; The dataset contains 25 variables and 52478 records corresponding to books on the GoodReads Best Books Ever list (the larges list on the site).The data was retrieved in two sets, the first 30000 books and then the remainig 22478. Dates were not parsed and reformated on the second chunk so publishDate and firstPublishDate are representet in a mm/dd/yyyy format for the first 30000 records and  Month Day Year for the rest.
Gabriela Argüelles Terrón; gabyarte; Linked Movie Database; https://old.datahub.io/dataset/linkedmdb; A linked-data collection of movies, actors, directors, and the relationships between them.

Guillaume Champtoussel; GuillaumeChamp; Top PC Games based on the metascore (metacritic.com); https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3712225; The dataset contains 6 columns and 199 rows of pc games with the highest metascore available on metacritic. The title and publisher column contains the title of the game and the name of the company that published the game. The rating column contains the rating of the game with "-" which means there is no rating. The user_score column contains the average rating given by the user to the game. The metascore column contains the results of the assessment conducted by the metacritics of the game.
Alejandro de la Cruz López; acrulopez; Manually curated transcriptomics data collection for toxicogenomic assessment of engineered nanomaterials; https://zenodo.org/record/5744003#.YyRNTexBw-Q; Toxicogenomics (TGx) approaches are increasingly applied to gain insight into the possible toxicity mechanisms of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). Omics data can be valuable to elucidate the mechanism of action of chemicals and develop predictive models in toxicology. While vast amounts of transcriptomics data from ENM exposures have already been accumulated, a unified, easily accessible and reusable collection of transcriptomics data for ENMs is currently lacking. In an attempt to improve the FAIRness of already existing transcriptomics data for nanomaterials, we curated a collection of homogenized transcriptomics data from human, mouse and rat ENM exposures in vitro and in vivo.
